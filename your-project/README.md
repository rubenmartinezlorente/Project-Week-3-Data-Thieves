## Project Description
Write a short introduction to your project: 3-5 sentences about the context of your topic and why you chose it.

## Questions & Hypotheses
The information we want to extract from the datasets and the API's related with beers and breweries are the followings:

1. What kind of categories of beers exists?
2. What are the main differences between these beers (hop, temperatures cooking, or bitterness)?
3. What beer (and category) has the maximum ABV (alcohol graduation)? and the minimum?
4. Is there any relationship between the ABV and the SEM (color of beer)?
5. Is there any relationship between the ABV and the fermentation temperature?
6. Which is the beer (and category) with more breweries?

## Datasets
There are three different resources (APIs and websites):

- Websites: four different databases for beers, breweries, category styles and geocodes.

    https://openbeerdb.com/

- APIs:

    Open Brewery: API with a directory of breweries in US, with their addresses. 
    
    https://www.openbrewerydb.org/#projects


    Punk Ipa: API with different information of beers providing: brands, description beers, food combination.
    
    https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2

Other important sources that support this analysis:

https://www.homebrewing.org/SRM-Beer-Color-Scale_ep_81-1.html#

## Database
The API from PUNKAPI, is mainly composed by different types of beer with additional information like color, alcohol by volumne, food pairings or data cooking. 

On the other side, the other datasets are formed by beer, beer's categories, breweries, style of beer, and other additional data like alcohol percentage.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
